Example:
What day of the week is January 7th, 2029?

command .getDay() will pull the day of week from object left of period

So, I would think we use javascript "Date()" object to instantiate a date

  let d = new Date ()

And now we can run .getDay() on d and save in variable?

  let day = d.getDay();

So now when we call "day", it should give us a number 0-6, which will correspond to days in week based on the built-in properties of the javascript "Date()" object. Which, according to the docs, the built in way js assigns 0-6 is: 0=sunday, 1=monday, so on.

So, if we write these functions that run when user submits their inputted date.... currently js spits out a number 0-6

I would think we create an array (like what you've written below), and create a prototype method to take the value of day, and spit out a string, of it's corresponding number in the array.

Not sure how to write this part yet, but essentially, if:
day returns 4, print string "" [4]





nameOfWeekday = "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"

0 Sunday
1 Monday
2 Tuesday
3 Wednesday
4 Thursday
5 Friday
6 Saturday
